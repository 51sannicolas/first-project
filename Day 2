Day 2

Please note that this is just a newly created file that does not affect the project whatsoever. Instead, it is for educational purposes. As you can see, I am still new to GitHub, so please bear with me. I intend to use this project as a test to discorver-ing what GitHub has to offer. It seems like GitHub is used mainly for documenting edits made to a particular project, whether it be my own edits or edits made by someone else. The master branch is sort of like the main project; however, other branches can be created from master. Branches made off of the master are intended to break up the project into smaller workable segments, without affecting the overall project in doing so. A branch off of the master is merely a copy of master, so any changes made to it do not affect the master file until it is committed via a pull request.
